# Railway-Register-and-booking-application-Using-MCV-Architecture
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is Implemented using NetBeans Java Framework.


•	Created attributes in the view part to take input from the user to register or book the railway tickets.
•	The controller connects view to the model, the model will take the user input, then update.
•	Changes are updated in view by  help of controller.
•	Controller acts like a bridge e between the view and model.
•	We used the Net-Beans framework for building the web application.
•	We created the 6 columns to store the database, the user input will have stored in the database.
•	When the user wants to transmit or receive data, the Controller responds by asking or sending the data from the Model. After that, the Controller sends the result (success or error) back to the View. View also operated via the Controller, inquiring about the data or adding it to the Model. Finally, the Controller validates the data for updating by the Model.
